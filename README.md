# dotfiles

On the quest to the perfect config.

Unfortunately a couple of these things only work on macos. To name a few:

- The script in my markdown file which allows me to add png links and auto add
  them to the directory

Things that have to be done:

1. Brewfile
1. Full installation script

Things to dowhen you're installing:

1. Symlink .zshenv to home. maybe look into using git stow just for this
   purpose
1. git sumodules --init --recursive to pull all submodules and the submodules
   of the submodules
